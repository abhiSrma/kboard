## Project Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
pnpm test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)

```sh
# Install browsers for the first run
npx playwright install

# When testing on CI, must build the project first
pnpm build

# Runs the end-to-end tests
pnpm test:e2e
# Runs the tests only on Chromium
pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium
# Runs the tests of a specific file
pnpm test:e2e tests/example.spec.ts
# Runs the tests in debug mode
pnpm test:e2e --debug
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
pnpm lint
```

## Further Actions:

- Add Tests unit and integration
- Simplify design further and make it more intuitive by grouping similar items together
- Add domain models to have better type safety
- Builds for different environments
- Break down the store / components for further separation of concerns
